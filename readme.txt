Blocks URL modifications if post is already public. URL can still be modified if the article is a draft.

== Description ==

In Wordpress you can change the post name, which will impact its final URL and probably mess up the SEO on that article, since search engines will think both the previous and the new URL are different contents. You could fix this arranging some 301 redirects, but with this plugin active you just won't be able to change that post name - hence its URL - unless the post is still in draft mode.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin file to the `/wp-content/plugins` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly;
1. activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress;
1. enjoy your super-simple seo-safe-url experience

== Changelog ==
